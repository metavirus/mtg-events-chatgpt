# Async Intake Queue

This queue accepts sourced discoveries, research questions, product ideas,
small corrections, and user requests from ChatGPT, Codex, or the future app.
It is triage input, not canonical data and not authorization to execute risky
changes.

## Rules

- Use one item per decision or outcome.
- New entities are always `candidate-discovery`; do not add them to canonical
  JSON until Codex deduplicates, researches, and promotes them.
- Include URLs or precise source descriptions for factual claims.
- Keep raw brainstorming separate from an asserted fact.
- Codex or a future daily agent may resolve easy safe items, research promoted
  candidates, or mark items `waiting-user` when a decision is needed.
- Significant durable work should also be represented in
  `docs/WORK_BACKLOG.md`; this file is the intake funnel, not its replacement.

## Status and type values

- Status: `new`, `triaged`, `in-progress`, `waiting-user`, `resolved`, `declined`
- Type: `candidate-discovery`, `research-follow-up`, `data-correction`,
  `product-idea`, `bug-report`, `watch-request`, `documentation`
- Risk: `safe-documentary`, `candidate-only`, `codex-required`
