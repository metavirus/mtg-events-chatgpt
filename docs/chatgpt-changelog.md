# ChatGPT Sideload Changelog

Purpose: This file records repository and data changes made from ordinary
ChatGPT sessions so Codex can audit them later. Entries remain pending until a
Codex audit explicitly changes their status.

## Unreviewed ChatGPT Changes

### 2026-07-15 — Sideload safety and handoff system created

- Request: Establish guarded ordinary-ChatGPT coordination for low-risk work.
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/chatgpt-sideload-sop.md`,
  `docs/chatgpt-changelog.md`, `docs/agent-mailbox.md`,
  `docs/ASYNC_INTAKE.md`, `CURRENT_FRONTIER.md`
- Summary of changes: Added safe/prohibited scopes, validation and audit rules,
  a structured intake queue, and a shared Codex/ChatGPT mailbox.
- Source support: Repository architecture and workflow files inspected locally.
- Validation performed: Documentation structure and referenced paths checked by
  Codex; no canonical app data changed for this system.
- Validation not performed: No browser test required for documentation-only
  changes.
- Known risks: GitHub-only ChatGPT sessions may not be able to run local checks;
  branch and PR discipline remains necessary.
- Codex audit requested: Confirm the ordinary-ChatGPT kickoff run follows the
  safe lane and does not create canonical entities.
- Status: pending Codex review
